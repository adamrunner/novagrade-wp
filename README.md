### Deploying to dev.novagrade.com

Generally, some of your changes will happen in the database - because WordPress.

Here are some scripts that will automate the majority of the work for you, they assume that your development environment is running locally on Vagrant, and that your local database name is `novagrade_development`. It also assumes that you have an SSH key copied to novagrade.com and you have a SSH Host entry so you can simply type `ssh novagrade` to connect.

They also assume that your `.my.cnf` file is configured so that you can log directly into `mysql` or `mysqldump` without using usernames and passwords.

1. `./upload_database [restore]` - This command will take the latest snapshot from your Vagrant machine and upload it to dev.novagrade.com, if you pass `restore` to the script, it will also restore it to the development database.
2. If you'd like to restore later: `ssh novagrade 'bash -s' < restore` - This command will restore the database on the development server with the copy you just uploaded.
